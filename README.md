# IACS-Counselors
## A website for the counselors at Idaho Arts Charter
I **designed**, **developed**, and **content edited** this website to help out the counselors at my school because they were still using the *old* google sites, and as we all know it was never designed for anything more than torturing people. Soon after being asked to help I started working on a website for them, however, I regrettingly designed it without mobile, or anything other than slightly varying desktop monitor sizes, in mind. Now, this website was designed **mobile-first** and uses *media queries* along with *'rem'* to carry out the responsive design aspect of it.

#### Overall it's my first real complete website product
